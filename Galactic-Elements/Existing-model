1. The Essence of the Periodic Law and System (A Theoretician's View)
The basis of everything is the Periodic Law formulated by D.I. Mendeleyev in 1869:

The properties of chemical elements, as well as the forms and properties of their compounds, are in a periodic dependence on the charge of the nuclei of their atoms.

This is the key phrase. Let's decipher it in modern terms:

The charge of the nucleus (Z) is the atomic number of the element (the number of protons in the nucleus). It is the fundamental characteristic of the element, and not the atomic mass, as was originally thought. The charge of the nucleus determines the number of electrons in a neutral atom.

A periodic dependence means that the properties of the elements are repeated (periodically) as Z increases, but each time with some development, like a spiral. Elements with similar properties are found at certain intervals.

The periodic table is a graphical expression of the Periodic Law. It is a way to arrange the elements so that this periodicity becomes visual.

Imagine music. The notes in octaves are repeated (do, re, mi...), but each subsequent octave is the same set of notes, only higher. So it is here: each new period is a new "octave" of elements.

2. The essence of the arrangement of elements (Analyst's view)
The analyst sees a system in the table that allows predicting the behavior of an element in a reaction, its valence, the type of bonds formed. The arrangement of elements is not random, it is subordinated to the structure of their electron shells.

Columns (Groups) are vertical columns. Elements in one group have the same number of electrons at the outer energy level.

This is the most important rule. For example, all elements of group I (Li, Na, K...) have one electron at the outer level. This is what causes their similar properties: they are all very active metals, they easily give up this electron, forming compounds with an oxidation state of +1.

The group tells us about the highest valence of the element in oxides and often about its "typical" behavior (metals, non-metals, noble gases).

Rows (Periods) are horizontal lines. The period number corresponds to the number of energy levels in the atom.

Elements in a period have the same number of electron shells, but the number of electrons in the outer shell gradually increases from left to right. Therefore, the properties of elements in a period change regularly.

Beginning of the period: active metals (alkaline, alkaline earth), which easily give up electrons.

Middle of the period: transition metals (d-elements) with variable valence.

End of the period: non-metals that tend to accept electrons.

Finalizes the period: an inert gas with a completely filled and stable electron shell.

Blocks (s-, p-, d-, f-) are areas of the table, allocated by the type of sublevel to which the last electron.

s-block (groups 1-2): Elements that have the s-sublevel filled. Strong reducing agents.

p-block (groups 13-18): Non-metals, semi-metals and some metals are located here. The p-sublevel is filled. The block ends with noble gases.

d-block (groups 3-12): Transition metals. They are the ones that give a huge variety of colored complex compounds and are catalysts. The d-sublevel is filled.

f-block (lanthanides and actinides): Internal transition elements. They have very similar chemical properties (which makes them difficult to analyze and separate), the f-sublevel is filled.

3. The essence from the point of view of a research scientist
For a researcher, the periodic table is:

A prognostic tool. Mendeleev did not simply systematize the known elements (there were 63 of them), he left empty spaces and predicted the properties elements that have not yet been discovered (eka-aluminium, the future gallium; eka-silicon, germanium). When they were discovered, their properties matched the predictions with astonishing accuracy. This is a triumph of the scientific method.

A guide to chemical behaviour. I see a new element. The first question is where is it in the table? Its group will immediately tell me about its possible valences and types of compounds. Its period will tell me about its size of the atom and its ionisation energy. Its block will tell me about its spectral and magnetic properties.

A reflection of quantum mechanics. Modern theory does not cancel the table, but explains it. The arrangement of the elements is a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, the Hund rule and the order of filling the electron orbitals. The table is a visual proof of the quantum-mechanical model of the atom.

A system for finding analogues. If I need a platinum-based catalyst (expensive and scarce), I look at its neighbours in the group (palladium, nickel) or period (iridium, rhodium) and I'm looking for a more affordable analogue with similar properties.

Brief summary
The essence of the Law: The properties of elements repeat with increasing nuclear charge.

The essence of the System: This is a visualization of the law, where the position of an element is uniquely determined by the charge of its nucleus and, as a result, the structure of its electron shell.

The essence of the arrangement:

Group (column) = Number of electrons on the outer shell = Chemical properties.

Period (row) = Number of electron shells = Atom size.

Block = Type of orbitals filled with valence electrons = Element "specialization" (metal/non-metal, catalytic properties, etc.).

The periodic table is not a frozen artifact, but a living, evolving system. The synthesis of new, superheavy elements continues to test its laws for strength and only confirms its genius. This is true poetry in the world of science.
