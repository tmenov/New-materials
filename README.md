# New-materials
New materials and compositions developed for the production of the devices we have described.

Some alloys, materials, compositions used in devices of alien origin are absent in their pure form on this planet. For this reason, we are constantly working on the creation of such alloys, materials, compositions and technologies that can serve as an analogue of those used in the original alien devices.
